# Basketball-Scoreboard

The Basketball Scoreboard project is part of the Frontend Developer Career Path by Scrimba. It's a SOLO Project where I need to follow a design on Figma and built from scratch.
The challenge was to build it from scratch, to follow the design and that the 6 buttonw must work. I had the small hover effect ;).

I use Figma, VS code and of course my bestfriend Google when needed.
